Wiring for RGB LED for Raspberry Pi
===================================



Connections
-----------


* Red: Red -> 68Ω -> Pin 12
* Power: Power -> Pin 6 (ground)
* Green: Green -> Pin 16
* Blue: Blue -> 6.8Ω -> Pin 18



I bought the LEDs [here at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Amico-Common-Cathode-Emitting-Diodes/dp/B005VMDROS/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?tag=harwoophotog-20)

They are Common Cathode RGB Light LED Emitting Diodes
